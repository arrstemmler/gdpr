# Working with personal data

The General Data Protection Regulation requires that people can revoke access to their data and that this data must be removed.

The extension makes it possible to exclude any record by activating a checkbox. After that, the record won't be accessible and available anymore, no matter if backend or frontend, editor or admin.

A new administration module gives editors the possibility to handle those flagged records and react with one of the following options:

- Completely remove the record from the database
- Reactivate the record
- Randomize content of the record [see Randomization](Randomization.md)

Every action regarding those flags is logged on a central place.

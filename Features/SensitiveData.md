### Hide sensitive data

The General Data Protection Regulation requires that people can revoke access to their data.
The extension makes it possible to exclude any record by activating a checkbox. After that, the record won't be accessible and available anymore, no matter if backend or frontend, editor or admin.

A new administration module gives editors the possibility to handle those flagged records and react with one of the following options:

- Completely remove the record from the database
- Reactivate the record
- Randomize content of the record (see below)

Every action regarding those flags is logged on a central place.

As additional security layer, this module must be explicitly enabled for every user - even for administrators.

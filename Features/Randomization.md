# Randomization


### Randomize data

Records can be randomized by using the `fzaninotto/faker`. By providing a mapping per table, is possible to exchange the data with dummy information which looks still ok and can be used in exports. An example would be

```
Array
(
    [username] => martens.conny
    [email] => gerhild.hartwig@yahoo.de
    [password] => 94n3ifyp($+%u#
    [zip] => 33781
    [address] => Hans-JÃ¼rgen-Sauer-Weg 21
86788 Oberursel (Taunus)
    [city] => Pfungstadt
    [first_name] => Miriam
    [last_name] => Sander
    [telephone] => +8747861395322
    [fax] => +5484337015644
)
```

#### Using a CLI command

By using a CLI command, all data with a specific age can be randomized: `./web/typo3/sysext/core/bin/typo3 gdpr:randomize`

Result can look like this

```
Randomize data
==============

Starting with table "be_users"
------------------------------

 // Randomization skipped as not enabled!

Starting with table "fe_users"
------------------------------

 // find all fields where value of field "tstamp" is older than 360 days

 [OK] 3 records randomized

```
